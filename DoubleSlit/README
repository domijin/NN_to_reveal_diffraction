Graphical User Interface
========================
The GUI for this program is written in GTK.  This works nicely on Linux, but
it may not be compatible with closed operating systems.  In the event that
this becomes a problem, the GUI will most likely be ported to Tk.  

Simulation
==========
This simulation is intended to be used to demonstrate the effects of Fresnel
diffraction in the double-slit experiment. By changing the parameters using
the user controls in the GUI, the user can see the change from quantum to
classical effects.

To run the program, type this command into the terminal:
python main.py
